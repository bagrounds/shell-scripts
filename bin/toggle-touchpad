# toggle-touchpad
#
# Toggle the touchpad on or off.
#
# Examples:
# $ toggle-touchpad # If touchpad was [on/off] it's now [off/on]
#
# Dependencies:
# - synclient
# - grep
#
# Tested on:
# - Linux Ubuntu 16.04

# List values with synclient, keep line containing 'TouchpadOff'
value="$(synclient -l | grep TouchpadOff)"

# If on, the line will look like "TouchpadOff = 0"
regexOn="TouchpadOff *= *0"

# If off, the line will look like "TouchpadOff = 1"
regexOff="TouchpadOff *= *1"

# if the line we pulled from synclient matches our regexOn
if [[ $value =~ $regexOn ]]
  then
    echo "turning touchpad off"
    
    # turn touchpad off
    synclient TouchpadOff=1

  # if the line we pulled from synclient matches our regexOff
  elif [[ $value =~ $regexOff ]]
  then
    echo "turning touchpad on"

    # turn touchpad on
    synclient TouchpadOff=0

  else
    # if it's not on or off...?
    echo "I'm confused"
